Fine needle aspiration (FNA), also called fine needle biopsy, is a type of biopsy where a needle is inserted into a lump or mass to collect a sample of cells. These cells are then looked at under a microscope to help your doctor determine if the mass or lump is cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is an efficient and reliable means for the evaluation of cancer cells, and it has been shown to have a diagnostic sensitivity of 89% to 98% and a specificity of 92%.
